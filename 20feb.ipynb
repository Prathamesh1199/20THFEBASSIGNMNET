    "1: GET and POST are HTTP request methods used to retrieve and send data between a\n",
    "client and a server. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\"GET METHOD\"\n",
    "  GET is a method used to retrieve data from a server. When a client sends a GET request\n",
    "    to a server, the server responds by returning the requested data in the response \n",
    "    body. GET requests are typically used to retrieve resources such as web pages, \n",
    "    images, videos, etc. from a server.\n",
    "One important characteristic of the GET method is that it is idempotent, meaning that\n",
    "multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request. Additionally,\n",
    "GET requests can be cached, which can improve performance and reduce server load.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\"POST METHOD\"\n",
    "  POST is a method used to submit data to a server. When a client sends a POST request\n",
    "    to a server, the server processes the data in the request body and may store or modify it.\n",
    "    POST requests are typically used for tasks such as submitting form data, creating new\n",
    "    resources, or updating existing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike GET, POST requests are not idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests \n",
    "may have different effects. POST requests are also not typically cached because\n",
    "they may result in changes to server data.\n",
    "\n"
